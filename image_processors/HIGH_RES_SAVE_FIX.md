# High-Resolution Save Fix

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: 2x high-resolution save was showing "High resolution version cancelled" 
- **Root Cause**: The `generate_biomorph` method was checking `self.is_generating` flag during high-resolution generation, which was `False`, causing the method to return `None`

## Solution Implemented
- **New Method**: Added `_generate_biomorph_uncancellable()` method specifically for high-resolution saves
- **No Cancellation**: This method is identical to the original but removes the cancellation check
- **Guaranteed Completion**: High-resolution saves will now complete successfully without being cancelled

## Features
- **2x Resolution**: Generates 2400x1600 pixel images (4x the pixels of standard 1200x800)
- **Same Quality**: Uses identical ultra-aggressive color mapping as standard resolution
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar with percentage completion
- **Time Estimation**: Shows estimated completion time (30-60 seconds for complex fractals)
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking operation - you can continue using the main interface

## Usage
1. Generate any fractal in the main interface
2. Click "Save Fractal" button
3. Select "2x - High Resolution (2400x1600)" option
4. Click "Save" and choose filename
5. Wait for progress dialog to complete (30-60 seconds)
6. Get ultra-high quality 2400x1600 image perfect for printing

## Technical Details
- Uses same parameters as current fractal (zoom, center, iterations, etc.)
- Applies identical color palette and mapping strategies
- Processes 3.84 million pixels (vs 960,000 for standard resolution)
- Maintains full quality with no upscaling artifacts
- Perfect for large prints, detailed viewing, or archival storage
